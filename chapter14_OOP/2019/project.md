# **Role-Playing game**

Implement a role-playing game according to the following specifications:

*   You have two players (player1 and player2).
*   Each player has the following characters (could be; tanks, cars, aircraft, dogs, lions, elephants, soldiers, spies, paratroopers, marines, commanders, engineers, doctors …). You are free to choose your characters.
*   Each character has some attributes such as name, life, hungry, fuel … depending on the character, and has some actions such as move, attack, jump, speak, … You are free to choose appropriate functions for your characters.
*   Each player has a turn.
*   In each turn, a player moves his characters and attacks the opponent. Movements and the state of the character (position, life, hungry, fuel …) are determined randomly.
*   Life and fuel attributes are decreased randomly.
*   The game continues until all characters of one of the players die.
*   When hungry and fuel reach to zero, then the character cannot move.
*   When life reaches to zero, the character dies.
*   In each turn, each object displays its state (name, life, position …) on the standard output screen.
*   (Tanks, cars, aircraft…) are vehicles
*   (Dogs, lions, elephants ….) are animals
*   (Soldiers, spies, paratroopers, marines, commanders, engineers, doctors …) are people

# Evaluation criteria

*   You should implement the project using object-oriented approach.
*   You should choose good names for your classes, objects, attributes, functions.
*   Your code should be documented (with comments).

You can ask for advice, help, tips until the due date.
