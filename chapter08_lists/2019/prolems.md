# Even indices / Even elements / Greater than left neighbor

Statement
Given a list of numbers, find and print all its elements that are greater than their left neighbor.

Example input
1 5 2 4 3

Example output
5 4


# Same sign neighbors

Statement
Given a list of non-zero integers, find and print the first adjacent pair of elements that have the same sign. If there is no such pair, print 0.

Example input #1
-1 2 3 -1 -2

Example output #1
2 3



# Lists: Greater than neighbors
Statement
Given a list of numbers, determine and print the number of elements that are greater than both of their neighbors.

The first and the last items of the list shouldn't be considered because they don't have two neighbors.

Example input
1 5 1 5 1

Example output
2




# Swap neighbors
Statement
Given a list of numbers, swap adjacent elements in each pair (swap A[0] with A[1], A[2] with A[3], etc.). Print the resulting list. If a list has an odd number of elements, leave the last element intact.

Example input
1 2 3 4 5

Example output
2 1 4 3 5




Lists: Number of distinct elements
Statement
Given a list of numbers with all elements sorted in ascending order, determine and print the number of distinct elements in it.

Example input
1 2 2 3 3 3

Example output
3
