LIGHT RICE KHEER RECIPE
Wash the rice well and soak for half an hour in enough water to fully cover it.
In a medium saucepan combine water and washed rice and bring to a boil, reduce heat, cover and simmer until rice is soft, about 25 minutes.
Add fat-free Sweetened Condensed Milk and stir over medium-low heat for 30 minutes or until thickens. Add the cashew nuts, raisins, and cardamom powder, and cook for few more minutes. Remove from heat and allow to cool before serving
